While we strive to make Snacktum a reliable and enjoyable platform, we cannot guarantee perfection.

                    Snacktum makes no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, as to the operation of the Site or the information, content, materials, or products included on this Site. To the full extent permissible by applicable law, Snacktum disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

                </p>

                <h3 class="3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    In no event shall Snacktum, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. In such cases, Snacktum's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Without limiting the foregoing, Snacktum shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    In no event shall Snacktum’s total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract or tort, including, but not limited to, negligence or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing this site or using the Services. This limitation is cumulative and will not be increased by the existence of more than one incident or claim.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">11. Indemnification</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Snacktum and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of (a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password; (b) a breach of these Terms; or (c) User Content posted on the Service.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    This indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Service. Snacktum reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Snacktum in asserting any available defenses. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Snacktum. This provision is crucial for protecting Snacktum from legal repercussions arising from misuse of the platform by users. For example, if your User Content infringes on someone else's copyright, you would be responsible for any legal fees or damages incurred.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Your obligation to indemnify Snacktum extends to all claims, demands, causes of action, debts, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable legal fees, arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms, your use of the Site or Services, or your violation of any rights of another. This includes, but is not limited to, any claims arising from content you submit, post, transmit, or make available through the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction/State/Country, e.g., the State of California, United States], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in [Your City/Region, e.g., Los Angeles, California], using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of [Arbitration Body, e.g., Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS")] then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal or state courts located in [Your City/Region, e.g., Los Angeles County, California], unless otherwise specified by the arbitration clause. This clause is critical for defining the legal framework under which any disputes will be resolved, ensuring clarity and predictability for both parties.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">13. Severability</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. This means that if one part of these Terms is found to be legally invalid, the rest of the Terms will still apply and remain in full force and effect. We strive for these Terms to be legally robust, but unforeseen circumstances or changes in law may necessitate such a clause.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    The intent behind this severability clause is to ensure that the overall purpose and function of these Terms remain intact even if a specific provision is challenged and deemed unenforceable. It prevents the entire agreement from being invalidated due to a flaw in one isolated part. This provides stability and continuity for both Snacktum and its users, ensuring that the foundational rules for engagement with the Site continue to apply. We will, of course, endeavor to amend any severed provisions to comply with applicable law while maintaining their original intent as closely as possible.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">14. Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    This "Entire Agreement" clause is important because it clarifies that this document, along with our Privacy Policy and any other explicitly referenced policies on the Site, represents the complete understanding between you and Snacktum regarding your use of the Services. It means that any previous discussions, informal agreements, or marketing materials that are not explicitly included or referenced within these Terms are not legally binding. This helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that all parties are operating under the same set of clear, written rules.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    By agreeing to these Terms, you acknowledge that you have not relied on any representation, warranty, or promise not expressly set out in these Terms. This clause is standard in legal agreements to ensure that the written contract is the definitive source of truth regarding the parties' obligations and rights. It provides legal certainty and reduces the potential for disputes arising from unrecorded or informal understandings. We strive for these Terms to be comprehensive and transparent, encompassing all aspects of your interaction with the Snacktum platform.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">15. Termination</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our Site.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability. This ensures that certain obligations and protections continue to apply even after the user relationship ends, particularly those related to intellectual property and legal liabilities. For example, if you have posted User Content, the license you granted to Snacktum for that content may survive termination.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    We may also terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. This includes, but is not limited to, engaging in prohibited uses, violating intellectual property rights, or any other conduct that we deem harmful to the Snacktum community or platform. Our decision to terminate is at our sole discretion and may be based on a variety of factors, including the severity and frequency of the violation. We are committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all snack worshippers, and this termination clause allows us to take necessary action to uphold that commitment.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">Information We Collect</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    We collect various types of information to provide and improve our services, including:
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-2xl text-electric-lime mb-3 fredoka">Personal Identification Information</h4>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, place an order, subscribe to the newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities. For instance, if you wish to participate in our "Flavor Builder" or "Snack Personality Quiz" features, providing certain personal details might be necessary to tailor the experience. This information is crucial for us to personalize your Snacktum journey and deliver content that truly resonates with your snack preferences.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl text-electric-lime mb-3 fredoka">Non-Personal Identification Information</h4>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer, and technical information about Users' means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. This data helps us understand how our Site is being used, allowing us to optimize its performance and user experience. For example, knowing which browsers our users prefer helps us ensure compatibility and smooth functionality across various platforms. This aggregated, anonymized data provides valuable insights into overall site traffic patterns and popular features without identifying individual users.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-2xl text-electric-lime mb-3 fredoka">Browser Cookies</h4>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly. Cookies help us remember your preferences, such as your favorite snack categories or whether you've participated in a "Snack Duel" vote, making your return visits more personalized and efficient. They are small text files stored on your device that allow us to recognize your browser and capture certain information.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">How We Use Collected Information</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Snacktum may collect and use Users' personal information for the following purposes:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6">
                    <li><strong>To improve customer service:</strong> Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently. This includes addressing inquiries about recipes, troubleshooting account issues, or providing personalized recommendations based on your interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>To personalize user experience:</strong> We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided on our Site. This allows us to tailor content, features, and promotions to better suit the collective interests of our snack-loving community.</li>
                    <li><strong>To improve our Site:</strong> We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services. Analyzing user behavior and preferences helps us identify areas for enhancement, such as optimizing page layouts, adding new snack categories, or refining interactive features like the "Flavor Builder."</li>
                    <li><strong>To process payments:</strong> We may use the information Users provide about themselves when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service. This ensures your transactions for Snacktum Swag or digital zines are secure and efficient.</li>
                    <li><strong>To run a promotion, contest, survey or other Site feature:</strong> To send Users information they agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to them. This might include exclusive access to new "SnackHub" video series episodes or early bird notifications for limited-edition snack merchandise.</li>
                    <li><strong>To send periodic emails:</strong> We may use the email address to send User information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests. If User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email or User may contact us via our Site.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">How We Protect Your Information</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Site. Our security protocols are regularly reviewed and updated to counter evolving threats and ensure the highest level of protection for your data. We utilize industry-standard encryption technologies for sensitive data transmission, such as credit card details, ensuring that your financial information is safeguarded during online transactions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Sensitive and private data exchange between the Site and its Users happens over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures. While we strive to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We also implement access controls and internal policies to limit access to your personal data to only those employees who require it to perform their job functions. Regular security audits and employee training reinforce our commitment to data protection.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">Sharing Your Personal Information</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your permission. For example, if we use an email marketing service, we would share your email address with them solely for the purpose of sending you our newsletter, under strict confidentiality agreements.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    In specific circumstances, we may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with a legal obligation; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Snacktum; (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users of the Site or the public; or (d) protect against legal liability. This includes cooperating with law enforcement or regulatory authorities when legally mandated. Any such disclosure would be carried out with due diligence and adherence to legal requirements, minimizing the scope of shared data to only what is absolutely necessary.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">Third-Party Websites</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that links to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. For example, if you click on an ad for a unique snack product, that third-party site will have its own data collection practices, which are beyond our control.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">Advertising</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile non-personal identification information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-3xl text-digital-cyan mb-4 fredoka">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-white mb-4">
                    Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. Our content, while fun and engaging, is primarily aimed at a general audience and not specifically at children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to use parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment.
                </p>
